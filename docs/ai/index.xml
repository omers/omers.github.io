NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.
A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that youâ€™ll be ready to apply them in future projects.</description></item><item><title>Python Scikit Learn</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:37:22 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</guid><description>Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities.</description></item></channel></rss>
