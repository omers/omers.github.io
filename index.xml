However, health data is highly sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to ensure patient&amp;rsquo;s privacy.
Anonymization or removal of patient identifiable information, though the most conventional way, is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and incorporate privacy concerns.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Resources Governance</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-governance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:56:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-governance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cloud Resources Dashboards</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:56:20 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-dashboards/</guid><description>During the lifecycle of a company, we are required to have an assets inventory.

The efficient indexing of log data distinguishes Loki from other logging systems. Unlike other logging systems, a Loki index is built from labels, leaving the original log message unindexed.
The Basic native tool to send data to Loki, is Promtail
A sample config file for Loki might seen like the follows:
server: http_listen_port: 0 grpc_listen_port: 0 positions: filename: /tmp/positions.yaml clients: - url: https://your.</description></item><item><title>Prometheus Common Queries</title><link>https://omers.github.io/cheatsheet/prometheus/common-queries/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 09:15:49 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/cheatsheet/prometheus/common-queries/</guid><description>Quantiles from histograms 90th percentile request latency over last 5 minutes, for every label dimension:

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.
A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that youâ€™ll be ready to apply them in future projects.</description></item><item><title>Python Scikit Learn</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:37:22 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</guid><description>Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.
