In order to setup your environment, You need to do some preperations:
Define what are the Groups in your organization Define which access each group needs, For example:
Developers group needs access to Grafana and server Superset Decide how to label each server / resource, and assign the labels to each resource Deinfe the policy that grants the access to the resources kind: role version: v5 metadata: name: Developers description: Developers Team Role spec: allow: logins: [&amp;#39;admin&amp;#39;] node_labels: &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Grafana&amp;#39; &amp;#39;type&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Superset&amp;#39;</description></item><item><title>Data Protection and Anonymization</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/data/anonymization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 09:14:01 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/data/anonymization/</guid><description>Mining health data can lead to faster medical decisions, improvement in the quality of treatment, disease prevention, reduced cost, and it drives innovative solutions within the healthcare sector.
However, health data is highly sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to ensure patient&amp;rsquo;s privacy.
Anonymization or removal of patient identifiable information, though the most conventional way, is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and incorporate privacy concerns.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Resources Governance</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-governance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:56:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-governance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cloud Resources Dashboards</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 09:56:20 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-dashboards/</guid><description>During the lifecycle of a company, we are required to have an assets inventory.

The efficient indexing of log data distinguishes Loki from other logging systems. Unlike other logging systems, a Loki index is built from labels, leaving the original log message unindexed.
The Basic native tool to send data to Loki, is Promtail
A sample config file for Loki might seen like the follows:

NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.
A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that youâ€™ll be ready to apply them in future projects.</description></item><item><title>Python Scikit Learn</title><link>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:37:22 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://omers.github.io/docs/ai/slearn/</guid><description>Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.
