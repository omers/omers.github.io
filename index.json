The mass demonstrates a rounded focus of signal prolongation with enhancement. The mass measures approximately 0.8 x 0.9 x 0.7 CM (anterior-posterior by transverse by superiorinferior). This appears similar to that noted on the prior CT. The mass just abuts the retromandibular vein, patent and medial to the right parotid duct. The mass is most consistent with a benign pleomorphic adenoma. No leftsided parotid mass is seen. Right and left submandibular glands are unremarkable. The mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract appear symmetric and unremarkable. The larynx is intact. The nasopharynx is symmetric without distinct lesion. The tongue and tongue base appear symmetric and unremarkable. The median raphe is midline. The thyroid gland appears symmetric without distinct nodule. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are found. The visualized lymph nodes demonstrate no central necrosis or extranodal extension. The right and left faucial tonsil is symmetric and unremarkable. The lingual tonsillar tissue appears symmetric and of normal volume. The posterior nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue does not appear enlarged. Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses reveals no significant sinus inflammatory disease. No air-fluid levels are noted. The central skull base is intact. The central petrous temporal bones and mastoids remain clear. The visualized base of brain appears unremarkable. Cervical spondylosis is noted, most notable for a broad-based disc bulge and dorsal osteophytic ridge at the C5/6 level with a C6/7 level focal 2 mm central disc protrusion and dorsal osteophytic ridging, resulting in mild central spinal stenosis. Mild foraminal narrowing also evident bilaterally. \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set up the engine, loads the NLP module (spaCy model by default) # and other PII recognizers analyzer = AnalyzerEngine() # Call analyzer to get results results = analyzer.analyze(text=text,language=\u0026#39;en\u0026#39;) print(results) # Analyzer results are passed to the AnonymizerEngine for anonymization anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine() anonymized_text = anonymizer.anonymize(text=text,analyzer_results=results) print(anonymized_text) The output text: PATIENT: \u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt; FILE #: 12345 PHYSICIAN: REFERRING EXAM: MRI ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST DATE: \u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt; Marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter are present in the right kidney (series 12 images \u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt;). Low signal intensity foci in the proximal right ureter (series 6 image 36) likely represents flow related artifact. Possible septations may be present in the distal right ureter (series 12 image 20). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast is recommended to evaluate for possible stone or distal obstructing lesion. Findings are new since the previous examination. Decreased enhancement of the right kidney in comparison to the left during the arterial phase (series 15 image 35) may reflect a renal compromise. Stable mild \u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt; is again noted in the left kidney. No mass is identified in the kidneys. No masses seen along the right ureter. Postoperative changes are seen from a distal pancreatectomy and cholecystectomy representing previous \u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt; procedure. There is dilatation of the pancreatic duct in the body and tail (series 6 images 23-20). No recurrent mass is seen in the pancreas or anastomosis. There is mild prominence of the biliary ducts in the left hepatic lobe (series 7 image 20). No filling defect is seen within the common duct. \u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt; and adrenal glands are unremarkable. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy seen. No bowel obstruction is identified. Anterior abdominal hernia is again noted containing small bowel without evidence of strangulation (series 7 image 33). There is marked S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine. No metastatic bone lesions are identified. items: [ {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 1296, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 1304, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 987, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 995, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 764, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 772, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 206, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 217, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;DATE_TIME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 105, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 116, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;DATE_TIME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 20, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 31, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;DATE_TIME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;DATE_TIME\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;}, {\u0026#39;start\u0026#39;: 10, \u0026#39;end\u0026#39;: 18, \u0026#39;entity_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;PERSON\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;PERSON\u0026gt;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;operator\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39;} ] ","permalink":"https://omers.github.io/docs/data/anonymization/","summary":"Mining health data can lead to faster medical decisions, improvement in the quality of treatment, disease prevention, reduced cost, and it drives innovative solutions within the healthcare sector.\nHowever, health data is highly sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to ensure patient\u0026rsquo;s privacy.\nAnonymization or removal of patient identifiable information, though the most conventional way, is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and incorporate privacy concerns.","title":"Data Protection and Anonymization"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-governance/","summary":"","title":"Cloud Resources Governance"},{"content":"During the lifecycle of a company, we are required to have an assets inventory.\nThe process of having an asset inventory contains few steps.\nCloudQuery As the tool that scrapes AWS and gather all the information, We will use CloudQuery\nTimescaleDB Apache Superset ","permalink":"https://omers.github.io/docs/cloud-management/cloud-resources-dashboards/","summary":"During the lifecycle of a company, we are required to have an assets inventory.\nThe process of having an asset inventory contains few steps.\nCloudQuery As the tool that scrapes AWS and gather all the information, We will use CloudQuery\nTimescaleDB Apache Superset ","title":"Cloud Resources Dashboards"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://omers.github.io/docs/monitoring/cloudquery/","summary":"","title":"Cloudquery"},{"content":"n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to automate tasks across different applications and services.
