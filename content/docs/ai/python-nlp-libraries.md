Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs. NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP.

A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it. In this tutorial, you’ll take your first look at the kinds of text preprocessing tasks you can do with NLTK so that you’ll be ready to apply them in future projects. You’ll also see how to do some basic text analysis and create visualizations.

If you’re familiar with the basics of using Python and would like to get your feet wet with some NLP, then you’ve come to the right place.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to:

* Find text to analyze
* Preprocess your text for analysis
* Analyze your text
* Create visualizations based on your analysis
* Let’s get Pythoning!
